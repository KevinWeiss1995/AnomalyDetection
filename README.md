# Anomaly Detection in Network Traffic

## Overview
This project trains a binary classifier to determine abnormalities in network traffic. A variety of techniques are used to improve performance such as K-Fold cross validation, 
natural gradient descent (KFAC), and a cyclic learning rate. The model acheives ~90% accuracy leaving a small amount of room for improvement. The model is trained with the CIC-IDS 2017 dataset 
which can be found here: https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html

## Code
The code is fairly straight forward.
